Reflection on PC Assembly
Participating in the PC assembly task was especially fulfilling since it allowed me to utilise my hardware knowledge. I focused on the accuracy of the details of components so that the position is not wrong when it is put back. It helped me understand how different pieces fit together and why each part is important. I became careful and cautious with some components because they were breakable and might not be restored if they fell. Apart from that, team working and finding guidance from experienced people are crucial, similar to when I completed my assignments.
