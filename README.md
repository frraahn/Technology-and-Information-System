# Reflection 
### Reflection on Industry Visit and Industry Talk
I discovered how applications like GitHub and LinkedIn are very crucial for students to showcase their skills to secure a job. Additionally, I considered joining activities related to our field offer lots of experience and knowledge for strenghtening leadership and improving teamwork. Furthermore, I think ICT is essential in industry for building innovation, efficiency, security, and competitiveness. It gives people the power to
significantly alter how businesses run and engage with their clients. Moreover, I determined to set a clear goals for my future. As I gaining my experience, creating portfolios showcasing my work, projects, and achievements is necessary for me to achieve my goal. Plus, building networks as much as I can by joining online communities and doing a good work while doing assignments. On top of that, I aim to secure a better jobs and will use my internship experience wisely.
### Reflection on PC Assembly
Participating in the PC assembly task was especially fulfilling since it allowed me to utilise my hardware knowledge. I focused on the accuracy of the details of components so that the position is not wrong when it is put back. It helped me understand how different pieces fit together and why each part is important. I became careful and cautious with some components because they were breakable and might not be restored if they fell. Apart from that, team working and finding guidance from experienced people are crucial, similar to when I completed my assignments.
### Reflection on Design Thinking
I am inspired to join the technology industry as a data scientist or data analyst. My goal is to use data analyst skills to help organisations and technology advancement by coming up with intelligent solutions. Design thinking provides five unique methods that help designers to solve issues. I can also detect customer difficulties more effectively thanks to design thinking. I hope to improve my potential by using the knowledge I've gained during my profession, especially by using the Design Thinking methods.
