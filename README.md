# Technology and Information System
Welcome to my Technology and Information System GitHub portfolio repository where I've compiled all my assignments for my first semester of my first year student in Computer Science (Data Engineering). This course will introduce students to information systems and technology (IS/IT) and its uses at home and work. Various aspects of IS/IT encompassing hardware, software, network and communications will be introduced. Students are equipped with basic skills in handling PC installation and productivity tools via practical work in the labs, which shall comprise a major part of the study. Each assignment is organized into separate directories for easy navigation.

<summary>Reflection on PC Assembly</summary>
Participating in the PC assembly task was especially fulfilling since it allowed me to utilise my hardware knowledge. I focused on the accuracy of the details of components so that the position is not wrong when it is put back. It helped me understand how different pieces fit together and why each part is important. I became careful and cautious with some components because they were breakable and might not be restored if they fell. Apart from that, team working and finding guidance from experienced people are crucial, similar to when I completed my assignments.

<summary>Reflection on Design Thinking</summary>
I am inspired to join the technology industry as a data scientist or data analyst. My goal is to use data analyst skills to help organisations and technology advancement by coming up with intelligent solutions. Design thinking provides five unique methods that help designers to solve issues. I can also detect customer difficulties more effectively thanks to design thinking. I hope to improve my potential by using the knowledge I've gained during my profession, especially by using the Design Thinking methods.
